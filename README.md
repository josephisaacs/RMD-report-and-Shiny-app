This project involved performing some simple hypothesis tests on a survey conducted on the DATA2x02 cohort in Semester 2, 2020. Report.html contains the final report, produced using RMarkdown. Report.Rmd contains the code used in the report. As a member of the unit's advanced stream I also produced an interactive Shiny app allowing users to perform their own hypothesis tests on the data, accessible at http://jimmio78.shinyapps.io/HypothesisTests
